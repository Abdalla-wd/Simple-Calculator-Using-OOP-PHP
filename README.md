# Simple-Calculator-Using-OOP-PHP

After finishing a short online course on youtube on the topic of OOP in PHP, I though of modifying one of the examples used in the course to accept user input and do the required calculations instead of using the preset values in the code and doing serial calculations on them. The original example is here:

After modification, you can enter two numbers, choose which operation you want the application to perform and click "Calculate" button to see the results.
